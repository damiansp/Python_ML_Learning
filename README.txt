# ML_Python

This is code I compiled while trying to learn the scikit-learn (sklearn) library for machine learning in Python.  Most of the initial work comes from
Sebastian Raschka's github repo (https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book)... which also exists in book form (http://sebastianraschka.com/books.html).  It is a wonderful resource.  If you have come to this code via my repo, please cite his work, and not mine.  Thanks!
